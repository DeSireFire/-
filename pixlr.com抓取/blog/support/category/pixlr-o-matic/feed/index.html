				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pixlr-o-matic is one of our oldest apps, and you can access it on the web here. But many people may now know that this darkroom-themed Flash app is available for download, too. It will work on a Mac or PC, but you will need to install Adobe AIR first. This is the only one of our legacy web-based apps that we offer as a download.<br />
<strong>How do I get Adobe AIR?</strong><br />
Adobe AIR is a free desktop app that serves as a &#8220;&#8221;wrapper&#8221;&#8221; for Flash-based apps that otherwise would run in a browser. You can download Adobe AIR from Adobe&#8217;s website here.<br />
<strong>After I install Adobe AIR, then what?</strong><br />
Once you&#8217;ve download AIR, you will want to download Pixlr-o-matic from here. Then, simply run this Pixlr-o-matic file (installer) you downloaded.<br />
Once you&#8217;ve installed Pixlr-o-matic, you can run it anytime you want â€” whether you&#8217;re online or not.</p>
