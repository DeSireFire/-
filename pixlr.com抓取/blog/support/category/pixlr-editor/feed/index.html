				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re using Safari 6 (on an older version of the Mac OS) and saving an image and it never seems to save — the saving spinner just spins and spins — there&#8217;s a reason for it. Apple changed the way that Safari interacts with Flash apps like Pixlr Editor to prevent Flash apps from saving to a hard drive unless the user changes a setting to tell Safari to allow saving from Flash apps. It&#8217;s an attempt by Apple to close what they consider a possible security hole in Safari. This can be a frustration for some users, but the good news is that it&#8217;s fixable.<br />
Adobe has published <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/removing-sandbox-restrictions-your-safari.html#">some information </a>that may be helpful if you are having trouble with Safari and Flash. Their very helpful article details how to allow Flash apps (like ours) to run in what Safari calls &#8220;Unsafe Mode.&#8221; While we don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s unsafe, it might solve some peoples&#8217; issues with Safari and Flash not playing well together.<br />
Alternatively, if you are a Mac user you can simply upgrade your operating system to Mavericks. Mavericks is a free upgrade provided by Apple here.</p>

While we&#8217;ve always provided free apps (desktop, mobile, web), we sometimes need to run ads in some locations. We don&#8217;t currently offer a way to remove those ads as part of a Pixlr Pro subscription, but it&#8217;s something we may offer in the future.</p>

<p>We know there are people out there who just want a speedy and free way to touch up photos or make banners or whatever. We respect that wish and do not require an account to use Pixlr Editor on the web. Just jump in and start creating. That said, if you prefer to save what you&#8217;re working on and come back to it later, we strongly recommend creating an account. Doing so creates your very own Pixlr Library where you can save all of your images privately.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re a Safari user who has installed OS X 10.11 El Capitan, you may run into a troubling issue when saving images in both Pixlr Editor and Pixlr Express: Your browser may freeze. Over time, Apple has restricted how Flash apps work in Safari, in some cases restricting Flash apps from saving to a local directory. This is an issue we are pursuing with Apple, but for now it&#8217;s a known issue that is outstanding.<br />
Luckily, there is a workaround. You can, of course, switch to using Chrome or Firefox to edit images in Pixlr Editor and Pixlr Express. But you can also set Safari to allow Pixlr apps to complete saves. Here&#8217;s how:<br />
First, open a tab to Pixlr Editor or Pixlr Express or simply visit pixlr.com.<br />
Head to Safari &gt; Preferences and choose the Security tab. Click on Plug-in Settings.</p>
<p>Adobe Flash Player should be automatically selected if you have visited pixlr.com. Change the settings for pixlr.com to &#8220;Run in Unsafe Mode&#8221; and click the Done button.</p>
<p>That will allow you to run these Flash-based apps in Safari. Of course, we completely understand if the phrase &#8220;Run in Unsafe Mode&#8221; scares you into using Chrome or Firefox instead!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are aware of an issue that some people experience saving images in Pixlr Editor. There are a few instances where we think this might be happening, so please check to see if one of these two apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using the Chrome web browser and are using it in INCOGNITO mode or Firefox and using private browsing you may have trouble saving. Our online apps are Flash-based and those modes may not allow Flash to save files to your computer.</li>
<li>If you are viewing the app in Full Screen Mode it may prevent you from saving an image.</li>
<li>If you are using Safari on a Mac, in some instances you may have trouble saving unless you allow Safari to save files to a local directory. Check out this article and see if this workaround helps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our team is aware of these issues, and they are investigating whether Pixlr Editor (which is a Flash-based app) can be changed to solve for these types of saving issues. For now, the best advice is to avoid Incognito or full-screen modes when working in Pixlr Editor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re using Pixlr Editor and find that you have difficulty using the Type tool to enter text, the issue may be rooted in the settings of your browser. We&#8217;ve heard from some Chrome and Firefox users who use Incognito or Private Browsing modes who cannot enter text. From our own testing of these reports, it appears that this private browsing mode conflicts with Flash (Pixlr Editor is built in Flash). We may tackle this issue in a future version of Pixlr Editor, but switching to the regular browsing mode is a good workaround until then.<br />
To exit Incognito Mode in Chrome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the X icon at the corner of the window.</li>
<li>Use the keyboard shortcut Alt+F4 (Windows and Linux) or ⌘-Shift-W (Mac).</li>
<li>Close the last tab in a window, which also automatically closes the window.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exit Private Browsing mode in Firefox, simply close the window.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re working in Pixlr Editor and creating multiple layers to design a flyer or ad or header (or anything else), you may want to come back and update your file later. If so, you will want to save your image as a .pxd file. The PXD file format is the native file format for Pixlr Editor, and it preserves the layers of text, images, etc. You can save those files with a .pxd suffix to your desktop or to a Pixlr Library.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pixlr Editor wasn&#8217;t designed to be compatible with PSD files. You will find that some very simple PSD files may open in Pixlr Editor, but more complex PSDs with layer masks or large files probably will not work. In many cases, an error #2030 will indicate that you are trying to open a PSD file that Pixlr cannot open or it may indicate that a .pxd file you are trying to open may be too large for our online editor to parse and read.<br />
Similarly, an error #2124 may indicate that you are attempting to open an image with a file format that Pixlr Editor does not recognize. For example, some proprietary RAW formats (e.g., Nikon&#8217;s NEF format) will not work in Pixlr Editor.</p>

However, if you tried to open an image from Google Drive and ended up on this page, it is because you clicked &#8220;Deny&#8221; when given the option to connect your Google Drive to Pixlr Editor or Pixlr Express.<br />
Not to worry. This is easy to fix. Simply open Google Drive, choose &#8220;Open with&#8221; and select the Pixlr app you want to use. When confronted with the choice to enable this integration, choose &#8220;Allow&#8221;.<br />
